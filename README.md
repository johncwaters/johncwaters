## About Me

Hello there!

Nothing bugs me more than a website or system with an abysmal user experiences. That is how you get people to quickly stop using your product/solution. I am passionate about developing software with an intuitive user experiences. 

I spend my spare time with my family, playing Table Tennis or video games, and listening to music. Preferably all at the same time.

**GLHF**
