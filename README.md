## About Me

Hello there!

Nothing bugs me more than a website or system with an abysmal user experiences. That is how you get people to quickly stop using your product/solution. I am passionate about developing software with simple code and creating an intuitive user experiences. 

I spend my spare time with my family, playing Table Tennis or video games, and listening to music. Preferably all at the same time.

### 📚 ~~Currently~~ Constantly Learning

- **Typescript** - for strong static typing.
- **C# .Net Core** - cause it's useful.
- **Astro** - for fast, optimized frontend delivery (and cause space themed 🚀).
- **UX Design** - to understand user needs and behaviours better (no more abysmal experiences plz).
- **React** - to build interactive UIs (cause 'everyone' is using it).
- **NextJs** - cause I need to expand from Astro.
