## About Me

Hello there! I'm John, a software developer who loves to turn ideas into reality using my programming skills. 

I am passionate about developing software with clean and efficient code and creating intuitive user experiences. Nothing bugs me more than website or system with an abysmal user experiences. That is how you get people to quickly stop using your product. 

### 📚 ~~Currently~~ Constantly Learning

- **Typescript** - for strong static typing.
- **C# .Net Core** - cause it's useful.
- **React** - to build interactive UIs (cause 'everyone' is using it).
- **NextJs** - for server-side rendering.
- **Astro** - for fast, optimized frontend delivery (and cause space themed 🚀).
- **UX Design** - to understand user needs and behaviours better (no more abysmal experiences plz).
